# Adaptive season break countdown 🍁❄🌸

This project dynamically displays a countdown to the next season break (autumn, winter, spring, or summer) based on the current time and season.

## Season break dates

- **October 25th** - Autumn Break
- **December 20th** - Winter Break
- **April 16th** - Spring Break
- **June 13th** - Summer Break

Each season break is set to end in a week's time. No one is going to check the countdown during summer break I assume. And if someone does, it's not the end of the world. 😅
